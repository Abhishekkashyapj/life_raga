This is a test document for file upload functionality.
The backend can now accept any text file and automatically process it.
Each line becomes a node in the vector database.
Files are stored locally in the ./rag_local/uploads/ directory.
This enables users to upload data without internet connectivity.
The system works completely offline after the initial server start.
All data persists locally on the user's machine.
Vector embeddings are created automatically for each line.
Graph relationships can be created between uploaded nodes.
Hybrid search works across uploaded data.
