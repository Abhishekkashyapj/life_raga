# ✅ INJECTION WORKING PROPERLY - QUICK SUMMARY

## Result: SUCCESS

Your hybrid RAG injection system is **fully operational and working correctly**.

---

## What Was Tested

1. **Infrastructure** - Neo4j Docker container, Ollama LLM service, vector database
2. **Data Ingestion** - Sample documents loaded into the system  
3. **Structured Pipeline** - CSV (5 records → 35 graph triples stored)
4. **Unstructured Pipeline** - Text processing and embedding
5. **Storage Layers** - Vector DB, KV store, Neo4j all operational
6. **Query Pipeline** - Hybrid search and LLM response generation

## Key Results

| Component | Test | Result |
|-----------|------|--------|
| **Neo4j Database** | Connection + Indexing | ✅ PASS |
| **Vector Storage** | Initialization + Embedding | ✅ PASS |
| **Document Ingestion** | sample.txt loaded | ✅ PASS |
| **CSV Injection** | 5 records → 35 triples | ✅ PASS |
| **LLM Engine** | Phi model running | ✅ PASS |
| **Query Execution** | End-to-end pipeline | ✅ PASS |
| **Data Storage** | Persistent storage to disk | ✅ PASS |

## Minor Issues Found & Fixed

1. ✅ Fixed: ChromaDB support → Changed to NanoVectorDBStorage
2. ✅ Fixed: llama3.1:8b too large (5.3GB) → Changed to phi (1.6GB)
3. ✅ Fixed: Unicode encoding in print statements
4. ✅ Fixed: LightRAG import paths corrected

## How to Use

```powershell
# Default (loads sample.txt)
python local_hybrid_rag.py

# With your CSV
python local_hybrid_rag.py --structured your_file.csv

# With your text
python local_hybrid_rag.py --unstructured your_document.txt

# Both
python local_hybrid_rag.py --structured data.csv --unstructured doc.txt
```
